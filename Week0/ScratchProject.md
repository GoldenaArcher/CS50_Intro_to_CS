# Scratch Project

[Snake](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/263424949/) is the scratch project that I was doing for this week.

# Idea for Snake
- ___initial_Page___: a blank game initiate page to recieve the information whether the game starts or not.
- ___game_start___: a page displays information notifies user to start the game. I tries to merge initial_page with game_start page, but some glitch hase occurred. Hence I decided to separate those two since they function well separately and looks cleaner.
- ___snake___: the sprite which does the major work.
	- Variables and Lists:
		- _direction_ set the direction which snake is going to move.
		- _speed_ sets the speed of snake.
		- _delay_ controls the actual speed that snake moves, the delay is decreased when snake eats food.
		- __directions__ contains all 4 directions that snake can move toward. I just feel that allow snake to move randomly at the beginning is more interesting.
- ___food___: when snake eats food, it will grow
	- ___partially implementation__
